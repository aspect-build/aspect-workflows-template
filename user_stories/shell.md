Write a simple Bash executable:

~~~sh
>hello.sh printf '#!/usr/bin/env bash\necho "Hello from Bash"'
chmod u+x hello.sh
~~~

We should be able to generate BUILD files, see .aspect/gazelle/shell.axl for the logic used

~~~sh
bazel run gazelle || true
~~~

Now we verify that running the Bash program produces the expected output.

~~~sh
output="$(bazel run :hello)"
[ "${output}" = "Hello from Bash" ] || {
    echo >&2 "Wanted output 'Hello from Bash' but got '${output}'"
    exit 1
}
~~~
