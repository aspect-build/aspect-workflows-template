This repo includes:
- ðŸ§± Latest version of Bazel and dependencies
- ðŸ“¦ Curated bazelrc flags via [bazelrc-preset.bzl]
- ðŸ§° Developer environment setup with [bazel_env.bzl]
- ðŸŽ¨ `shfmt` and `shellcheck`, using rules_lint

## Try it out

Write a simple Bash executable:

~~~sh
>hello.sh echo -e '#!/usr/bin/env bash\necho "Hello from Bash"'
chmod u+x hello.sh
~~~

We should be able to generate BUILD files, see .aspect/cli/shell.star for the logic used
bazel run gazelle || true

# Verify that running the Bash program produces the expected output
# FIXME: wire up orion
# output="$(bazel run :hello)"
# [ "${output}" = "Hello from Bash" ] || {
#     echo >&2 "Wanted output 'Hello from Bash' but got '${output}'"
#     exit 1
# }
