This repo includes:
- 🧱 Latest version of Bazel and dependencies
- 📦 Curated bazelrc flags via [bazelrc-preset.bzl]
- 🧰 Developer environment setup with [bazel_env.bzl]
- 🎨 `prettier` and `eslint`, using rules_lint
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for automatic linting and formatting
- 📚 PNPM package manager integration

## Developer tools

> Before following these instructions, setup the developer environment by running <code>direnv allow</code> and follow any prompts.
> This ensures that tools we call in the following steps will be on the PATH.

The Bazel-managed version of pnpm is on the PATH thanks to direnv:

~~~sh
which pnpm
# -> bazel-out/bazel_env-opt/bin/tools/bazel_env/bin/pnpm
pnpm list
~~~

## Node.js program

The repo already contains a pnpm workspace.
Let's add a new package to it, which will use the `chalk` npm dependency.

~~~sh
mkdir -p packages/hello
cd packages/hello
pnpm init
pnpm pkg set type=module
pnpm add chalk
~~~

Now create a tiny Node.js program:

~~~sh
>index.js cat <<EOF
import chalk from 'chalk';
console.log(chalk.green('Hello World!'));
EOF
~~~

Observe that the program already works outside Bazel:

~~~sh
pnpm pkg set scripts.hello="node index.js"
npm run hello
# -> Hello World!
~~~

Running our program under Bazel is easy, we just need `BUILD` files, which can be generated with the Gazelle tool.

~~~sh
bazel run //:gazelle
bazel run //packages/hello
# -> Hello World!
~~~

## Code generation

We can use Yeoman to scaffold out a library and add its dependencies:

~~~sh
pnpm add -w generator-bazel-fastify-route
yo bazel-fastify-route
~~~

## Linting

ESLint is already setup in the repo. Bazel doesn't have a lint command, so we use the Aspect CLI:

~~~sh
aspect lint
~~~
