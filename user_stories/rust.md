## Try it out

> Before following these instructions, setup the developer environment by running <code>direnv allow</code> and follow any prompts.

First we create a tiny Rust program

~~~sh
mkdir -p hello_world/src
cat >hello_world/src/main.rs <<EOF
fn main() { println!("Hello from Rust"); }
EOF
~~~

We don't have any BUILD file generation for Rust yet,
so you're forced to create it manually.

~~~sh
touch hello_world/BUILD
buildozer 'new_load @rules_rust//rust:defs.bzl rust_binary' hello_world:__pkg__
buildozer 'new rust_binary hello_world' hello_world:__pkg__
buildozer 'add srcs src/main.rs' hello_world:hello_world
~~~

Now you can run the program and assert that it produces the expected output.

~~~sh
output="$(bazel run hello_world)"

[ "${output}" = "Hello from Rust" ] || {
    echo >&2 "Wanted output 'Hello from Rust' but got '${output}'"
    exit 1
}
~~~
