## Try it out

First we create a tiny Rust program

~~~sh
mkdir -p hello_world/src
cat >hello_world/src/main.rs <<EOF
fn main() { println!("Hello from Rust"); }
EOF
~~~

We don't have any BUILD file generation for Rust yet,
so you're forced to create it manually.

~~~sh
cat >hello_world/BUILD <<EOF
load("@rules_rust//rust:defs.bzl", "rust_binary")

rust_binary(
    name = "hello_world",
    srcs = ["src/main.rs"],
)
EOF
~~~

Now you can run the program and assert that it produces the expected output.

~~~sh
output="$(bazel run hello_world)"

[ "${output}" = "Hello from Rust" ] || {
    echo >&2 "Wanted output 'Hello from Rust' but got '${output}'"
    exit 1
}
~~~
