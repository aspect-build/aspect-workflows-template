## Try it out

> Before following these instructions, setup the developer environment by running <code>direnv allow</code> and follow any prompts.
> This ensures that tools we call in the following steps will be on the PATH.

First create some Kotlin source code:

~~~sh
mkdir src
>src/Demo.kt cat <<EOF
package app

class MyApp {
  companion object {
    @JvmStatic
    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
      println("Hello from Kotlin")
    }
  }
}
EOF
~~~

Then run the BUILD file generation:

~~~sh
bazel run gazelle
~~~

This doesn't include Java support yet, so we need to run a couple commands
to manually create the java_binary target:

~~~sh
buildozer 'new_load @rules_java//java:java_binary.bzl java_binary' src:__pkg__
buildozer 'new java_binary app' src:__pkg__
buildozer 'set main_class app.MyApp' src:app
buildozer 'add runtime_deps :src' src:app
~~~

Now we can verify that the application runs and produces the expected output:

~~~sh
output="$(bazel run src:app)"

[ "${output}" = "Hello from Kotlin" ] || {
    echo >&2 "Wanted output 'Hello from Kotlin' but got '${output}'"
    exit 1
}
~~~
